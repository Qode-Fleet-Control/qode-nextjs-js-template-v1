# Next.js (JavaScript) template

Provisioned from [`Qode-Fleet-Control/fleet-template-v1`](https://github.com/Qode-Fleet-Control/fleet-template-v1) — the fleet
lifecycle contract (`bin/`, `fleet.conf`, deploy workflows, `compose.yaml`) with a Next.js 16 App Router app in plain JavaScript laid on top.

Listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (default `3000`) and serves at the root (`/`) of its own hostname
(`https://<hash>.<FLEET_APP_DOMAIN>/`); the health check hits `/health`. In the container: the standalone Next.js server (`node server.js`).

## Origin

    npx create-next-app@latest qode-nextjs-js-template-v1 --js --eslint --app --no-src-dir --no-tailwind --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm --skip-install --disable-git --yes

Generated 2026-10-05 with create-next-app 16.3.8 (host Node v22.12.0 / npm 10.9.0).

## Run it

### On the fleet

The fleet clones the repo, injects `PORT` (and the workspace's `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, ...) and runs
`bin/run`, which uses the docker runtime from `fleet.conf`: `docker compose build`, then `docker compose up --remove-orphans` in the foreground.

### With docker

    PORT=3000 bin/run                  # what the fleet does
    docker compose up --build        # or plain compose

### Without docker

`FLEET_RUNTIME=process bin/run` runs the plain commands from `fleet.conf`:

| step | command |
|---|---|
| install | `npm install` |
| build | `npm run build` |
| start | `npx next start -H 0.0.0.0 -p $PORT` |

    ./bin/run       # install, build, start in the foreground
    ./bin/start     # start from existing build artifacts
    ./bin/restart   # rebuild and restart
    ./bin/stop      # stop whatever holds the port

See `docs/fleet-lifecycle.md` for the full contract.

## Deviations from the generator output

- `next.config.mjs` sets `output: "standalone"` (the image's runtime stage copies `.next/standalone`) and `allowedDevOrigins` from `FLEET_APP_HOST` (so `next dev` serves its HMR assets to the fleet hostname).
- Added `app/health/route.js` (`GET /health` -> `{"status":"ok"}`) for the fleet health check.
- `npm audit` reports a high advisory in `braces` via `eslint-config-next` (lint-time dev dependency, not in the image); left as generated since the only offered fix downgrades Next's ESLint config.
- `package-lock.json` added (`npm install --package-lock-only`) so the image build can use `npm ci`.
- Added the fleet files: `bin/` (lifecycle scripts), `fleet.conf`, `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `.dockerignore`, `.env.example`, `.github/workflows/`, `docs/fleet-lifecycle.md`; fleet entries (`.fleet/`, `*.log`, ...) prepended to `.gitignore`.

## Verified

**Not yet verified in docker.** On 2026-10-05 the shared docker host's disk stayed at 0-2 GB free for over 3 hours (held by other workloads), so the image was never built; `verify.sh` / `docker compose run` must still be run before this is trusted. `migrate.py audit`: READY.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
